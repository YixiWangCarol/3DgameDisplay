Gsap(GreenSock Animation Platform) is easy to use and so cool!!!
There are many optional plugins and easing functions for achieving advanced effects easily like scrolling, morphing, animating along a motion path or FLIP animations. 

Display of the game and characters in "3D" visuals. By sliding the mouse, the characters "stand up" from the cards. Very cool!
